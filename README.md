### What I learned

While this challenge didn't introduce new concepts, I used it to deepen my understanding of CSS. One aspect I enjoyed was utilizing nesting for cleaner code:

```css
/* this is first time i'm accually use this esudo class */
li::marker {
  color: var(--Nutmeg);
}
```

### Continued development

My focus is on further improving my use of CSS to enhance frontend design.
